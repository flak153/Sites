            <h1>Vision Statement:</h1>
            <h5>The Stony Brook Global Innovation Team works on projects presented to them by students throughout campus. GIT was presented with a task of creating a garden in Stony Brook’s Nobel Halls. One of the issues they are faced with is finding a way to water the garden automatically. They’ve requested our help to create an algorithm that automatically controls a solar powered water pump and waters the plants based on upcoming weather and other factors such as humidity and soil moisture. The goal of the project is to be as water efficient as possible. With the project already using a solar powered water pump and collected rainwater, our algorithm use sensors to predict when it is absolutely necessary to water the plants, rather than watering on a daily schedule. If this project is a success, we plan of expanding our algorithm to accommodate agricultural needs.</h5>

            <h1>Users:</h1>
            <h5>Yang College RHD would be in control of the algorithm, and would pass it down to any succeeding RHD.</h5>

            <h1>Features: </h1>
            <h5>Automatic weather detection. <br/>
                Soil moisture and humidity sensing. <br/>
                Manual factor adjustment - User can decide which factors are more important to the algorithm.</h5>

            <h1>Constraints:</h1>
            <h5> How the algorithm will function depends on the irrigation system, which has not been built yet. We also do not know what sensors we will have available. </h5>
